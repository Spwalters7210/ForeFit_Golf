# ForeFit_Golf

For this project, I decided to create a simple e-commerce site for a fictional golf store by the name 
of FOREFIT. As an avid golfer, I wanted to build a website around something I am passionate about. 
The project was primarily completed using HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript incorporated as 
well. In my first project deliverable, I mentioned that I am really interested in front-end 
development but still believe it's important to have some knowledge of backend integration. 
Therefore, I included a login feature using a user's Google account to apply skills I learned in this 
Course.
However, I made a few changes from my first deliverable. For starters, the store's theme shifted 
from a luxurios feel to a more outcast/unique brand. Also, Instead of drawing inspiration from the 
two orginal sites I referenced ,Apple and Rose Island, I decided to take inspiration from existing 
golf apparel brands, Good Good Golf and Bad Birdie Golf.
My wife also played a huge role in helping me complete this project. As a graphic designer, she 
helped create the logo and overall look of the of site. After we achieved the look we were hoping 
for, I then started to bring it to life through code. I am happy to be able to app this project to my 
portfolio.
